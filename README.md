# Gemini-Agentic-Extension
A simple extension that enables Gemini features in the context menu. It's a multi-step, general-purpose AI agent browser extension that teaches itself how to navigate websites as it goes.

This is a learning project I built with the help of Gemini 2.5 Pro. It's not perfect, but it works, and I welcome any constructive feedback! It's extremely slow and doesnt always nail the task exactly, but it does function!

Put all files into a folder and load as unpacked in your browser (tested in Opera GX). You will need to supply your own Gemini API key upon first use. 

# Current Features

- Selecting text and getting a summary/explanation of what it is
- Right clicking an image and, after inputting a prompt, can explain, identify, or edit images via nano-banana (not 100% working but works when it wants)
- Can be used as a shopping agent on various websites like eBay and Amazon
- Can be used to build a food order on websites like Doordash and Dominos
- Includes a full history of actions it's taken, and said history is searchable
- it's also technically capable of independent webpage navigation based on prompt, like if you right click an image and prompt it to find the cheapest of whatever's in the image on ebay, it'll figure out what's in the image, navigate to ebay, search for it, sort by lowest price, and click the first link, all automatically
- Prompt window can be moved and overlaid on any page
